Create a modern, futuristic landing page for GrowithCP AI — an AI website consultant for non-tech and non-designer people. The purpose is to help visitors understand what kind of website they actually need and also guide them on pricing.

🎨 Design Style

Use the same reddish–maroon liquid gradient + black matte finish inspired by Bolt AI.

Background should have flowing liquid gradients, soft glows, and subtle depth.

Use glassmorphism panels and smooth micro-animations.

Everything must feel premium, futuristic, and clean.

🧠 Core UX Requirement

When the user lands on the website:

Step 1 (Collapsed Mode)

Show one centered chat dialogue box with the text:
“Confused about website needs?”

Show a single input field + button.

This box should be minimal, floating, and animated slightly.

Step 2 (Expanded Chat Mode)

When the user types anything or clicks Start:

The chat box should expand into a full chat interface.

It should load the external chat UI inside an iframe pointing to:
https://giguai.growithcp.live/chat

The expansion must be smooth, animated, and futuristic.
